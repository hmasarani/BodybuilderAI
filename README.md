# I created an AI tool that helps you create a workout based on your favourite bodybuilder routine

In this project, I used the following tools: 
- OpenAI: You'll need to use your OpenAI API Key in order to use this service
- LongChain: Machine learning framework to simplify the development of this application using large language models (LLMs)
- Streamlit: easily deploy this application online
